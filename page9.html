           <h1> Initial Ideas</h1>           

           <p> Fallerz is an app that myself and Aarul Malayiva decided to design and develop during our last semester at University. 
           </p>
           <P>The initial idea for the app was taken from our original game Droppinz which we successfully uploaded to the Apple and Andorid stores last summer. We wanted to challenge ourselves and build something that was more complex in both design and development. We began by researching other apps on the market and using the studio space to brain storm and conceptualize ideas. We had to come up with an idea that was unique and provided the user with replayability. My focus during this project was UI, UX and Graphic design. I wanted the app to showcase my ability to design for code and how I can come up with a unique concept within a time scale.

          <h1> Brainstorm </h1>   

          <p> To begin the project, I used a sketchbook and whiteboard in the studio to collect ideas on how we could approach the project. We researched various other apps such as <a class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mr-jump/id955157084?mt=8"> Mr Jump</a> and <a class="link" href="http://altosadventure.com/"> Altos Adventure</a> that showed promising level and UX design to generate ideas. These apps are both very different yet work in their own unique way. Both use landscape orientation in their app and are based on movement of a character. We decided to begin working with both lanscape and portrait ideas to experiment with certain features we could use. For example a landscape orientation is better for trackpad movement where as portrait is better for drag and tap motions.

      <p> We decided to work with a portrait orientation because of the dropping aspect and believed it would work better with our initial level ideas. I then began to start thinking about layout and ideas of story within the game. I wanted the game to be memorable and the style of the game to flow through each scene and menu. I researched some strong flat design stories and decided to base the game on South Park designs. These flat design graphics were simple yet bold. 

        <h1> Concept </h1> 

       <p> The concept for the game was created after days of research and adapting ideas. Our initial idea was to make a game that allowed the player to drop through worlds and collect items that will allow for the player to progress. We wanted to make the game educational at first but differed from the idea with the new concept. I decided to create a set of characters that people could relate to, similar to that of Southpark. We wanted the characters to dodge items related to certain areas in the world, for example Mountains, Jungles and Oceans. I began to draw UI sketches in a book to plan out the interface for the app.</P>

      <p> We decided to use a side scroll menu that simplified the interface. The menu would start off as a the play screen. Once the user taps the play button the menu would instantly become the play screen in order to keep continuity throughout the game. A major difficulty we faced was working out how long each section would be. We had to come up with a formula to work out the canvas sizes so I could design them to the right scale.

      <p> Once this forumla was created I could begin to work on designing assets for the game. I began with the characters as these were the main focus of the game. The characters were designed in Adobe Illustrator. I needed to make sure they were all unique and looked as if they were free-falling. I also had to design assets for the characters to evade during free-fall. These included objects such as rockets, birds and chinese lanters. Each seperate section of the free-fall had unique objects to avoid. I also made clouds and other aesthetic assets for the game to give a sense of depth to the enviroments. Below you can see a selection of characters and assets I created for the game.

    <p> I had to animate sections of graphics to use within the game like the rocket above.

      <!-- Photo Section End -->

      <p> The animations are made using Photoshop timeline editor and are then exported into Unity ready to be used within the game. I was then able to start creating the UI for the game. I used photoshop to create the menu mockup. The first example which can be seen below was not used however some aspects were carried over to the final version. This design was too complicated and needed to feature more simple UI aspects.

      <img src="images/fallerz/mockup.png" class="image1" alt="Underwater">

      <!-- Photo Section End -->

      The final UI consisted of swipe gesture menu screens that animated as the menu scrolls across. An example of this can be seen below. The sun and moon transition is an effect that is used to simulate the transition of pages but in a unique way.

      The menu UI features three simple pages. The navigation is easy to understand and has been tested by us mutiple times in order to create a seamless experience.
