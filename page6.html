          <h1>Digital Media Prospectus<span>.</span></h1>

           <hr />    


           <h1> The Idea </h1>           

           <p> During a recent University event at the Excel London Centre I noticed along with my lecturers that the standard of prospectuses being given out by other Universities were exceptional. The University of Winchester has its own prospectus, but we wanted one for our own course specifically. The Digital Media Design & Development Course prides itself on creativity and technology. We needed a way to show that, through print.  </p>

           <p> I took it upon myself to design a prospectus for the course from scratch. There is an existing <a class="link" href="http://www.winchester.ac.uk/Studyhere/Documents/Undergraduate%20Course%20Leaflets/Digital%20Media%2005153.pdf"> leaflet </a> on the website presenting information about the course that I could use for text. However, it did not present itself visually with any of the students work. After flicking through other universities design prospectuses it was apparent we needed something new.

            <h1> The Front Cover </h1> 

            <p> The University of Kent stood out at the event. They had produced not just a prospectus, but a magazine. It looked and felt professional. I wanted our course to have something simliar, something that screamed read me when you pick it up. The most important part in visual terms for a prospectus is the front cover. I spent days researching design magazines such as Digital  Arts, Web Designer and Layers. I studied the colours, use of typography and use of imagery on the front. Layout was key.

        <div class="twelve columns">

        <p> I played around with the layout of the prospectus using some initial sketches. The focus was to lay the front cover out so that all the information needed is bold and present whilst still maintaining an element of creativity. The target audience is 17 - 18 year olds looking to find a suitable University to study at the following year. Feedback given from peers and friends showed that a teenager would much rather pick up something that looked like a magazine than they would a booklet. The result of this is because we are used to magazines containing interesting facts and images.  
        Below is a layout sketch to plan the location of key information that would be needed on the front cover. </p>

        <div class="twelve columns">

          <p> I decided to run with a simple yet bold cover to start with. The colours I used were complementary to one another and the information presented was strong and very present. Below is the first idea I came up with for a cover. I liked it, but it wasn't what we needed. I was finding it difficult to create ideas for the cover to begin with because I felt it needed to reflect what was inside the magazine. I realized it would be better for me to concentrate on the content of the magazine and then come back to the front cover later on. </P>
