           <h1> Overview </h1>           

           <p> The site you are currently on is a project of mine I have been developing over the last two months since October. It is built in  <a class="link" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2"> Sublime Text 2 </a> which is a "sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose." </P>
            <p> The site is a cultivated layout of grids and subtle CSS animations that bring it to life. To view the source code click <a class="link" href="view-source:http://woodyreeves.github.io/"> here. </a> The idea for the site was to display my collection of projects in a bold yet simplistic way. As you can tell I have made the decison to use full body images to give them impact so that the site is more visually desirable. The website is fully responsive for mobile and tablet using CSS grid systems and max width displays. </p> 
            <p> An example of each can be seen below. </p>

            <h1> The Site </h1>           

           <p> The site is built in my favourite text editor Sublime Text 2. I have grown fond of Sublime over the last year and am using a series of inbuilt packages to help speed up the process of writing my code. These vary from multiple cursor usage to code shortcuts. The font I used is called Open Sans and is in my opinion a clean and simple typography set. I have sourced the font from the  <a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans"> google API. </a>     </p>

           <p> The site is hosted using  <a class="link" href="https://github.com/WoodyReeves/woodyreeves.github.io"> Git Hub </a>. This was useful as I could host the site for free and constantly update it during the build. It also allowed me to comment the code as it was uploaded and changed through their commits page to keep track of the changes I had made. </P> 

            <p> I was also able to pull some jquery elements from sites like <a class="link" href="http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/"> I make web things </a> as I am still getting to grips with writing Jquery myself. This helped to create functioning way points that enabled the nav bar to directly scroll to different sections of the home page. </p>

            <h1> Learning Outcomes </h1> 

            <p> This personal Portfolio project has taught me so much valuable development knowledge. I have learnt how to make use of Jquery which I hadn't touched before hand. In past website projects I was using basic HTML and CSS but the research behind this project and the help of other peers proved useful when it came to stepping up my game. I have also learnt how to quickly upload sites to Github and make use of the commit section, enabling me to backdate the site if any errors went wrong. </p>

           <p> Overall the project was a success and it is a perfect platform to host my projects and other design work. I have learnt valuable skills and techniques that I will be able to use when building my next website, either for myself or a client. Improvements I am still working on include updating several other minor projects I have been working on as well as increasing the speed of load times within the site. </P>
