           <h1> The Research</h1>           

           <p> Before constructing the concept for <a class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1027073853#"> Droppinz </a> , I began to do research on apps that we would like to base our game on. This involved downloading and playing around with a wide selection of simple apps. I focused my research on a specific company called Ketchup Games. This company has had many top download games on the APPLE store with their simple yet addictive concepts. 

            Myself and Aarul Malaviya spent days working on research and ideas for an app that we could create during the summer. A game called Ball Jump by Ketchup games had remained the number one spot on the APPLE store for over a month. This was due to its replayability, simplicity and crisp design. 
            We decided to create a game that was equally as simple to play.

                <p> Whilst researching I was able to use the studio space to plan and conceptualize the app idea. 
                  Below are some wire frames and screen ideas we drew on the white board. This was useful to help plan the UI and visualize our ideas and share
                  them with each other. The research we did on other apps fed through to the white board. Luckily, we were the only ones using the studio over the summer and therefor could keep our ideas planted there for when we returned the next day.

           <h1> The Sketching</h1>           

           <p> I used my sketch book to design the UI for the game and wire frame the app. The UI was based on other apps I had researched previously, using simplicity as a key tool. It was helpful to sketch out the app before taking it into photoshop so that I could quickly understand what I needed to do. I even planned out colour palettes using my sketch book and then taking it into Adobe Kuler to create the full range of colours.

           <h1> The concept</h1>           

           <p>Droppinz was a game concept I thought of during the summer of 2015. Over the course of three months it developed into 
            a fully functioning app that is now available on the APPLE STORE and ANDROID STORE.

        <p> The aim of our self created project was to create an app that was simple enough to play using a single tap of the finger. Market research showed that 
          some of the most popular games on the market were also the simplest. This resulted in a stage of planning based on how a game could remain fun and replayable yet remain simplistic and understandable.

          <h1> The Designing</h1>

        <p> The Design of the app took the longest amount of time. I was working with a friend on the app who was able to give feedback which helped. 
          I was in charge of UI/UX and the whole design of the product. My partner was in charge of development through Unity. 
          The app was, initially, all created on a white board in the studio. </p> 

         <p>  Below is a Sprite sheet for the game animations and objects that were then imported into Unity. 
         I designed them in Illustrator and then compiled the sheet in Photoshop as a PNG, ready to send over. 
         We faced a few issues with pixelation but quickly navigated round the problems. The designs were based off the initial character sketches I had done on paper and the whiteboard. It took a while for me to get the animations smooth enough to use within the game. They required a certain amount of frames so that the movement of the dropping character worked perfectly. I had never created a sprite sheet before so I had to learn quickly.
        </p>
        <p> The Themes for the game were created via the colour palettes I created through Kuler. A dark and Light Theme were added to the game to give the user a bit of customization in the game. I found this to be a noticable thing Ketchup games were adding to their latest updates, for example Ball Jumps scoring and colour changes update. This meant I had to design the UI in three seperate themes.

          <h1> The Testing</h1>


        <p>  The app is compatible with multi generation apple products, from the 3GS to the 6S and IPad. It is also available on Android. 
          We had to test the app mulitple times to make sure there were no bugs for release. We gave the app to several collegues and friends to play
          around with. We asked them how repetative they thought it was as well as any improvements they would like to see. 

          The feedback we received was very positive saying it was fun, simple and addictive. 
          Many of the top selling games on the app market are addictive. They have a score value which makes people want to beat their friends. 
       </p> 
       <P> The main bug was the character being able to fly into the top of the screen and above the line of sight. We quickly fixed this problem. 
        An update for the game was added after feedback was given about wanting leaderboards. Game Centre was intergrated so that scores could be shared between friends.

          <h1> Final Product </h1>

        <p> Droppinz was a very successful self created project that went through a long development stage through to a fully functioning app available for 
          download on the app and android store. The app is still being updated ever so often to enhance the game.
          If you would like to download the app, please visit the apps website http://droppinz.co.uk/ for more info on the game.
          The game has recieved multiple 5 star ratings on the digital stores from users.</p>

          <h1> Mock Ups </h1>

        <p> I wanted to showcase the app in its final state so that it looked visually pleasing. To do so I used a free mockup and imported the design through photoshop and adjusted the lighting to
          create a realistic digital reconstrution of how it looks.</p>

         <h1> Learning Outcomes </h1>




          <p> I developed a wide variety of my skills during this app project</p> 
          <p> I taught myself how to create scalable UI designs that worked with old and new Apple and Andorid phones. 
            The challenges I faced through the character animation process also gave me the oppertunity to research sprite sheets and importing them from illustrator. The project as a whole was very challenging when it came to the usability across multi platforms (Phone, Ipad), but I was able to feedback to my project partner as we researched the problems together.
