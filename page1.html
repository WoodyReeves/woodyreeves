           <h1> The concept</h1>           

           <p>Droppinz was a game concept I thought of during the summer of 2015. Over the course of three months it developed into 
            a fully functioning app that is now available on the APPLE STORE and ANDROID STORE.

        <p> The aim of our self created project was to create an app that was simple enough to play usng a single tap of the finger. Market research showed that 
          some of the most popular games on the market were also the simplest. This resulted in a stage of planning based on how a game could remain fun and replayable yet remain simplistic and understandable.

          <h1> The Designing</h1>

        <p> The Design of the app took the longest amount of time. I was working with a friend Aarul Malaviya on the app. 
          I was in charge of UI/UX and the whole design of the product. Aarul was in charge of development through Unity. 
          The app was, initially, all created on a white board in the studio. The game concept of a dropping blob character came to me
          after researching the classic game Lemmings. </p> 

         <p>  Below is a Sprite sheet for the game animations and objects that were then imported into Unity. 
         I designed them in Illustrator and then compiled the sheet in Photoshop as a PNG, ready to send over. 
         We faced a few issues with pixelation but quickly navigated round the problems.

          <h1> The Testing</h1>


        <p>  The app is compatible with multi generation apple products, from the 3GS to the 6S and IPad. It is also available on Android. 
          We had to test the app mulitple times to make sure there were no bugs for release. We gave the app to several collegues and friends to play
          around with. We asked them how repetative they thought it was as well as any improvements they would like to see. 

          The feedback we received was very positive saying it was fun, simple and addictive. 
          Many of the top selling games on the app market are addictive. They have a score value which makes people want to beat their friends.

          <h1> Final Product </h1>

        <p> Droppinz was a very successful self created project that went through a long development stage through to a fully functioning app available for 
          download on the app and android store. The process made use of UI/UX skills, Photoshop, Time Management and many other aspects. 
          If you would like to donwload the app, please visit the apps website http://droppinz.co.uk/</p>
