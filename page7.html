           <hr />    


           <h1> Meeting </h1>           

           <p> I was given a project by the University Of Winchester to create a new brand for Street Food On Campus based on their specific guidelines. 
           I went for a meeting with the clients over a coffee and we discussed the overall aim of the project as well as the specifics such as colour and print size. The van colour was undecided and they wanted my opinion on what colour would work best with a strong visual logo. I suggested a black van because
           my initial thoughts were that the logo would stand out much more on a darker background. After an hour or so I left the clients and began to research other styles of van logos. The clients explained how they wanted it to represent 'Street' without it looking too unprofessional. They suggested graffiti style text. The university also said they wanted some sort of character to represent the brand. I took this information on board and started to sketch out some ideas. </p>

          <h1> Research </h1>           

           <p> At this point I was unable to see any blue prints of the van. This was a problem because I was unsure of how much space I was able to use on the 
            van. Instead of focusing on the actual design I spent the first few days just researching other van logos as well as researching colours and styles of graffiti. The colours #e54791 and #85a20a (Pink & Green - Seen Below) were the two main shades they wanted to use throughout the logo. This was to keep a running theme through their university logos. </P>

                   <p> I researched many different styles of graffiti. The main trouble with graffiti is that a lot of it is unreadable and too visually messy. 
                   A quick <a class="link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=graffiti+styles&rlz=1C1CHWA_enGB643GB643&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjckJWv28zJAhUKJh4KHYrvDMgQ_AUIBigB"> google </a> search of graffiti will prove that its main representation is through spray cans onto walls. I was told by the clients that I was able to use other colours and styles if I beleived they would work better. 
                   To begin with I started sketching characters and creating idea boards on adobe illustrator to give my clients a visual concept.

           <p> I sent the character sheets to the clients but it was difficult at first to get a response because they were so busy. I decided to continue with
        the cartoon teenager street theme to start with and add some colour to the basic designs. I wanted to make sure I had a sufficient amount of work to show them at the next client meeting.  </p>

        <p> The character above was one a secleted from the trio character drawing I did. I took inspiration from van logo ideas on <a class="link" href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=van+logo"> Dribbble </a>. The character is a 'cool' and 'friendly' looking chef with heat flames behind him to represent the heat of world foods and, even simpler, the fire from cooking.   </p>

        <h1> Meeting two </h1>

        <p> The second meeting took place a week after I had been set the project. I showed them my initial ideas and sketches and they were pleased with the outcome. They were able to give me the blue prints for the van so I had an idea of the scale in which I needed to design the logo. 
          I suggested that I emailed them every couple of days to update them on how the project was coming along. I was told to focus more on the font and colouring the text. </p>

        <h1> The Logo </h1>

        <p> I started to compile the concepts together to create finalized logos. I needed to make sure the logo was created in illustrator as a vector so that it can be resized when sent over to the printing company. I decided to create a mockup of the logo on a black van to represent what my first idea would look like. I kept the character in just to give them options and make sure they didnt want one. </P>

       <p> I sent them the logo ideas via email. It took a while to get a response but when I did they liked the text logo but still decided a character 
       was unneccessary for the van. I worked on creating a clean text logo that also featured 'street' style graffiti. The final logo was taken from my original character logo with some added splash paint graphics over the 'on' text.  </P>

          <h1> Learning Outcome </h1>

       <p> During the process of this three month long project I learnt a lot about how to work with real clients as a freelancer.
       I was difficult at times to get a reponse and time management was key so that I got an oppertunity to meet with the university staff to discuss the logo.
       I learnt how to design print logos in illustrator and the best ways to go about uploading and downloading the graphic files to keep maximum quality.
       Not only did I learn practical skills, but I enhanced my ability to cope with the pressure of a real life deadline, with a goal of getting the food van out onto the streets before the open day at university. </p>
